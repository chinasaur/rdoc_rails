To install as a Rails plugin, try some variation on one of the following:
  ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/chinasaur/rdoc_rails.git
  ruby script/plugin install http://github.com/chinasaur/rdoc_rails.git
  ruby script/plugin install http://github.com/chinasaur/rdoc_rails.git/

You may then want to rename the directory <tt>vendor/plugins/rdoc_rails.git/</tt> to
just +rdoc_rails+.

After that, you should be good to go.  The standard <tt>rake doc:app</tt> or
<tt>rake doc:reapp</tt> should now run the Rails customized RDoc commands.
